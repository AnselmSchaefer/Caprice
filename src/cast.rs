//! The cast: the people of the story, as Claude should paint them. The writer describes each one
//! once, and Claude can draw them a model sheet: the figure from the front, the side, behind and
//! sitting, as SVG. Whenever a scene is painted, everyone its passage names goes with it, their
//! look in words and their sheet to copy the figure from. So they look the same in every picture
//! of the book, though the story never says again how they look. People are found by name, or by
//! another name the writer gives them, as whole words (`Doc::named_in`). A passage that names no
//! one ("He climbed the ladder") is about those the paragraph just before it named, so they are
//! carried on (`App::carried_people`), until a break in the story. The list of scenes says who each
//! was painted with, and the writer can choose others and paint it again.
//!
//! Someone can have several looks (as a girl, after the shipwreck), each with its words and sheet.
//! One is in use at a time, chosen by the writer, and scenes painted from then on get that one.
//!
//! The cast is kept with the document and never exported, like the story notes.
