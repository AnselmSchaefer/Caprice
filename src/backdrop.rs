//! Scenes behind the pages. Claude paints a scene as SVG (through the Claude Code CLI), and it is
//! kept with the story, pinned to where it begins, like a note. It covers the story up to the next
//! scene, and the page shown shows the one the caret is in, faintly behind its text, so the
//! pictures change as the caret moves on through the story. A scene is one the writer describes, a
//! passage they select, or follows the writing: as sentences are written, Claude groups them into
//! scenes by what they say, and each scene is painted once the next begins, so no picture mixes
//! two places.
//! Painting again for the same scene adds a version to it rather than replacing it. The list of
//! scenes shows them all, to go to, show again, step through versions, hide or delete.
//!
//! Drawings are rendered on a background thread when a page near the one shown needs them, and
//! only those near are kept as textures.
