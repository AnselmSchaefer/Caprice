//! Asking Claude about a passage. With the pen on, drawing a loop around text selects it and
//! opens a menu of commands; picking by cursor instead, letting go of a selection opens it (review, fix, grammar, summary, or a question of one's own). The answer
//! streams into a floating panel, from where a corrected passage can be put in place of the old one.
//!
//! Connecting scenes: the passage holds the end of one scene and the start of a later one, and
//! Claude finds the gap between them and suggests ways across. From there it is a conversation:
//! the writer replies, asks for a draft (the passage again with the gap filled), or pins an idea
//! as a post-it. Claude only ever sees the passage, what the writer types for it, and the story
//! notes, kept with the document, which say what the writer always wants it to know.
//!
//! The request goes through the installed Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`) on a background thread.
//! The CLI uses its own sign-in, which Caprice never sees, and streams the answer as it is written.
